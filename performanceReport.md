---

## **üìå Introduction**
### **Objective:**
This report analyzes and compares the performance of **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) vs. Pessimistic Concurrency Control (PCC)** when handling concurrent transactions in an Esports Tournament database.

### **Scenario Overview:**
- **OCC is tested** by simulating multiple players registering for the same tournament concurrently.
- **PCC is tested** by simulating multiple administrators updating the same match result simultaneously.

---

## **üìå Experiment Setup**
### **Database Schema Used:**
```sql
-- Add your database schema here
```

### **Concurrency Control Techniques Implemented:**
- **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)** using a **version column** in the `Tournaments` table.
- **Pessimistic Concurrency Control (PCC)** using `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` when updating `Matches`.

### **Test Parameters:**
| Parameter        | Value |
|-----------------|-------|
| **Number of concurrent transactions** | [Your Value] |
| **Database** | [Your Value] |
| **Execution Environment** | [Your Value] |
| **Java Thread Pool Size** | [Your Value] |
