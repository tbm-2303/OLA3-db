# **Performance Analysis Report: Optimistic vs. Pessimistic Concurrency Control**

## **üìù Student Names: [Timothy Busk Mortensen]**

## **üìå Introduction**
### **Objective:**
This report analyzes and compares the performance of **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) vs. Pessimistic Concurrency Control (PCC)** when handling concurrent transactions in an Esports Tournament database.

### **Scenario Overview:**
- **OCC is tested** by simulating multiple players registering for the same tournament concurrently.
- **PCC is tested** by simulating multiple administrators updating the same match result simultaneously.

---

## **üìå Experiment Setup**
### **Database Schema Used:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Players (
    player_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    ranking INT DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE Tournaments (
    tournament_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    game VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    max_players INT NOT NULL,
    start_date DATETIME NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    version INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
);

CREATE TABLE Tournament_Registrations (
    registration_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    tournament_id INT NOT NULL,
    player_id INT NOT NULL,
    registered_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (tournament_id) REFERENCES Tournaments(tournament_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (player_id) REFERENCES Players(player_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE Matches (
    match_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    tournament_id INT NOT NULL,
    player1_id INT NOT NULL,
    player2_id INT NOT NULL,
    winner_id INT NULL,
    match_date DATETIME NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (tournament_id) REFERENCES Tournaments(tournament_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (player1_id) REFERENCES Players(player_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (player2_id) REFERENCES Players(player_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (winner_id) REFERENCES Players(player_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

### **Concurrency Control Techniques Implemented:**
- **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)** using a **version column** in the `Tournaments` table.
- **Pessimistic Concurrency Control (PCC)** using `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` when updating `Matches`.

### **Test Parameters:**
| Parameter        | Value |
|-----------------|-------|
| **Number of concurrent transactions** | [10 from ExecutorService] |
| **Database** | [MySQL 8.0] |
| **Java Version** | [OpenJDK 23.0.2 ] |
| **IDE** | [IntelliJ IDEA 2024.3.2] |
| **Java Thread Pool Size** | [10 (from Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10))] |

## **üìå Results & Observations**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) Results**
**Test Scenario:** 
- Simulated 10 concurrent threads attempting to register the same player (ID: 3) into the same tournament (ID: 1). 
- TO create multiple threads that run transactions concurrently, I used the same approach as in the recommended note; https://github.com/Tine-m/final-assignment/blob/main/performance-test.md.
- Version based OCC on registering players in tournaments. 
    - Reads the current version of the tournament.

    - Attempts to insert the player into the Tournament_Registrations table.

    - Commits only if the tournament version has not changed, ensuring only one transaction succeeds.

    - If a version mismatch occurs, the transaction rolls back and retries.

| **Metric** | **Value** |
|-----------|----------|
| Execution Time (ms) | [1130] |
| Number of successful transactions | [1] |
| Number of retries due to version mismatch | [9] |

**Observations:**
- [The thread that happens ot be first updates the version. all the subsequent transactions will first fail beacuse of this version mismatch(OCC). The 9 failing thread will then all retry. On the the retry they all fail due to the player already being registered. this will also be reflected in the console but with 10 threads its to big to include screenshot.]
